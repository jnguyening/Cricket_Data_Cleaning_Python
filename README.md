# Cricket Batting Averages Data Cleaning with Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **cleaning cricket batting average data** using Python. The dataset was sourced from [ESPN cricinfo's Highest Career Batting Averages](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910) using Excel’s **“From Web”** feature to import the table directly into a spreadsheet. The workflow includes cleaning and restructuring the data for analysis—handling issues like missing values, inconsistent formats, and non-numeric entries. This project demonstrates how to integrate web data extraction with Python-based data cleaning to prepare sports statistics for further analysis or visualization.
